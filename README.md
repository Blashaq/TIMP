# Twilight Imperium Message Protocol

Have you ever felt the need to secretly talk to someone while playing board games? 

You probably already know that this quite easy to do in modern days- just pick up a phone and write him up, right?

Maybe you felt that something is lacking?

Maybe you felt that it kills your immersion? 

Maybe you would want strategic options while doing so, or give other players a chance to counteract?

Maybe you wish to incorporate espionage options?

We have something for you: **TIMP**!

* customise message latency (well, messages have to travel through whole galaxy to the player on the other side of the board, right?)
* allow (or not) other players to detect communication between players
* customizable communication hijack options like:
	- chance to capture whole message,
	- chance to capture part of the message,
	- customize how partial messages are represented
	- espionage cooldown and/or resource usage,
	- chance for spied player to detect espionage
	- chance for spied player to detect what was leaked
	- customizable espionage scope (last n messages, a period of time)
* customizable message cooldown and/or automated espionage to prevent excess usage during game
* very simple setup, easy to use and safe

More features planned, like custom skins for other board games!

Feel free to propose features, or contribute yourself!
